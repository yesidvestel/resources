# -FIVEM-Standalone-Engine-Stalling
A simple standalone script that stalls your vehicle upon impact and also causes dizziness to the player (U were in an accident it's the least u get)
 You can configure :
 1. Stall Duration
 2. Minimum Speed for Stalling
 3. Minimum Damage for Collision
 4. Dizziness Duration
 5. Dizziness Intensity
in the config.lua

Just add the script to the resources folder and ensure it in the server.cfg or start it via the server console and it should work.
