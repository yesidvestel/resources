# an-policecarmegaphone
 
A small script i wrote to add the ability to have a megaphone in the cop cars

- You can either run this by itself or get the megaphonepolice.lua and add it to your qb-policejob client and add it to your fxmanifest 

# Usage: 
- Hold LeftShift and keep holding it and then use your push to talk to speak loudly.
